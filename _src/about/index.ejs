				<h3 class="h1">Where we come from</h3>
				<p>Lake Afton Public Observatory opened in 1981 as a joint project between Wichita State University, Wichita Public Schools, Sedgwick County and the City of Wichita. The university primarily managed the observatory until 2015. The observatory then went dark after 34 years of acquainting hundreds of thousands of visitors with the stars and planets.</p>

				<h3 class="h1">Where we're going</h3>
				<p>Thanks to members of the <a href="http://kaowichita.com">Kansas Astronomical Observers</a> and <a href="https://openwichita.com">Open Wichita</a>, the observatory was saved from permanent closure and reopened on Sept. 2, 2016. It will continue to operate as a nonprofit supported by volunteers. In addition to letting visitors experience celestial bodies through the 16-inch Ritchey-Chr√©tien telescope, Lake Afton Public Observatory will feature exciting new exhibits and special events.</p>
				<p>Our goal now is to modernize the observatory while providing a unique learning experience for visitors from around the US. We've started incorporating new technology including Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality games and experiences, which can keep guests learning and entertained even on cloudy nights.</p>
